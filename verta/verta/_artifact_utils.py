def reset_stream(stream):
    """
    Resets the cursor of a stream to the beginning.

    This is implemented with a try-except because not all file-like objects are guaranteed to have
    a ``seek()`` method, so we carry on if we cannot reset the pointer.

    Parameters
    ----------
    stream : file-like
        A stream that may or may not implement ``seek()``.

def ensure_bytestream(obj):
    """
    Converts an object into a bytestream.

    If `obj` is file-like, its contents will be read into memory and then wrapped in a bytestream.
    This has a performance cost, but checking beforehand whether an arbitrary file-like object
    returns bytes rather than encoded characters is an implementation nightmare.

    If `obj` is not file-like, it will be serialized and then wrapped in a bytestream.

    Parameters
    ----------
    obj : file-like or object
        Object to convert into a bytestream.

    Returns
    -------
    bytestream : file-like
        Buffered bytestream of the serialized artifacts.
    method : {"joblib", "cloudpickle", "pickle", None}
        Serialization method used to produce the bytestream.
