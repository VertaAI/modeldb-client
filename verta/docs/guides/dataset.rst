Logging a Data Version
======================

We'll walk briefly through the concept of data versioning, and how it can be handled by the Verta
client!


Setup
-----

This guide assumes a basic familiarity with Verta's client interface.

Imagine we have some CSV files stored on `Amazon S3 <https://aws.amazon.com/s3/>`_ that we would
like to associate with our workflows. We'd like to keep track of which files we're accessing, and
when they are accessed.

First, we'll need to install ``boto3``, the official Python library for Amazon Web Services:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install boto3

Installing the Verta client did not install ``boto3`` automatically since it's not required for
core functionality, but it is required for data versioning with S3.

Don't worryâ€”Verta doesn't download or store the actual S3 object; instead, we take in just enough
information for you to later identify the snapshot of data that was used.

After installation, make sure AWS credentials are set up in your local environment, following their
`official instructions <https://pypi.org/project/boto3/>`_.


Version Logging
---------------

Now, in Python, we'll instantiate the :class:`~verta.client.Client`:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from verta import Client
    >>> client = Client(host, email, dev_key)
    connection successfully established

The client can be used to create an :class:`~verta._dataset.S3Dataset`:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> dataset = client.set_dataset(name="Important Data",
    ...                              type="s3")

A *Dataset* is a collection of related *DatasetVersion*\ s, and we'll need to create an
:class:`~verta._dataset.S3DatasetVersion` to be logged:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> dataset_version = dataset.create_version(bucket_name="datasets",
    ...                                          key="important-data.csv")

Note here that ``key`` is optional; if omitted, we would instead be tracking the entire bucket.

As we track our data science workflow, we can log this dataset version:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> run.log_dataset_version("training_data", dataset_version)


Version Viewing
---------------

Once a dataset version is logged, it can be viewed in the Verta Web App.

You'll find the dataset version in the **Datasets** section of the ExperimentRun page:

.. image:: /_static/images/dataset-version-section.png

Clicking on *training_data* will direct you to the DatasetVersion page:

And there, you'll find information about your dataset version:
